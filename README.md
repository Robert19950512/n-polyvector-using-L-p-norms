# N polyvector using L^p norms
===
This repository cintains materials which is used for testing how different norms affect curl of the field and the polyvector field quality based on different p value. the project is carry out under the supervision by professor (Daniele Panozzo)[http://cs.nyu.edu/~panozzo/], and is based on the code and research from (Olga Diamanti)[http://web.stanford.edu/~diamanti/]. The test is carried out on summer 2016. some code and method is based on https://github.com/libigl/libigl/
